This is a university group project and hence has to be the work of the participants of the course.

You can provide hints about mistakes we made, e.g. common memory allocation errors,
but you shouldn't contribute in a way that this project can't be seen as the work of this group anymore.

After the due date of this project (something like 15th of July, 2020) we'd be thankful for all kinds of helpful contributions.
